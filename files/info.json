Additionally, I have a keen interest in electronics, often engaging in the development and programming of embedded systems, IoT and circuits as hobby projects. Music holds a special place in my heart, and I am an avid keyboard player who also dabbles in music mixing, mastering, and production. My love for science is immense, and whenever I come across something related to it, I am always eager to learn more. Since childhood, I have been naturally curious and inquisitive about the world around me.",
